Hi! I'm Nathan Daly, a software engineer, and sometimes an actor, living in
Providence, RI. I worked at Google for 3 years, mostly on the google.com search
engine. After that, I co-founded a startup that provides recruiting and
training for solar panel installers.

A fun fact about me is: I'm [terrified](https://xkcd.com/1732/)
[about](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPCC_Fifth_Assessment_Report#Projections)
Climate Change. But I'm also [inspired](http://worrydream.com/ClimateChange) by
[its challenge](http://tnp_encoded_videos.s3.amazonaws.com/web_videos/140927_FONG_FULL_WEB_9100.mp4).
I like solving problems, and I'm good at it, and I want to apply that towards
tackling the climate crisis: energy, the grid, transportation,
politicsâ€”whatever it takes.

<br>**Presented at JuliaCon 2018** about my package [ApplicationBuilder.jl](https://github.com/NHDaly/ApplicationBuilder.jl): _"Building Julia Apps and So Can You!: Compiling and distributing desktop applications written in Julia"_. ([Youtube link](https://youtu.be/kSp6d3qSb3I?t=5m23s))



## Current Interests
**Julia lang**  {% include icon-julia-logo-three-balls.html %} I'm super excited about the future of the [Julia Language](https://julialang.org)! I attended [JuliaCon 2017](http://juliacon.org/2017/) in Berkeley, and am looking forward to [JuliaCon 2018](http://juliacon.org/2018/) in London!

It was actually the essay I linked above,
[worrydream.com/ClimateChange](http://worrydream.com/ClimateChange) by Brett Victor,
that first introduced me to Julia and motivated me to contribute! Since then,
I've found an incredibly inviting and intelligent community, and an exciting
language for numerical computing, machine learning, and more!

Good science and engineering will be critical to our future. Helping to build
Julia is a small part of changing science and engineering tools for the better.

These days, I'm working on an [Application Builder toolchain](http://github.com/NHDaly/ApplicationBuilder.jl) so you can build, distribute, and sell Apps written entirely in Julia.

**Mandarin language (æ±‰è¯­)** I've been studying Mandarin Chinese since 2011.
I would say I'm conversational. Learning any language is a big commitment, but I
love the challenge and the chance to learn more about Chinese culture! For other
learners out there, I really love the audio lessons on [chinesepod.com](http://chinesepod.com)!

**Making Games** I'm making games! Check out my games page: [nhdalyMadeThis](/MadeThis.html)

**Random From Distributions**  I made this small Unity package, which
provides functions for generating random numbers from various statistical
distributions (normal, linear, exponential, etc). I've been surprised and
pleased with how much people like it! ðŸ˜Š
