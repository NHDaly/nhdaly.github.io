Hi! I'm a Software Engineer, and sometimes an actor, living in Chicago. I'm
currently working on the google.com web server (GWS) at Google's Chicago office.

A fact about me is: I'm [terrified](https://xkcd.com/1732/)
[about](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPCC_Fifth_Assessment_Report#Projections)
Climate Change. But I'm also [inspired by](http://worrydream.com/ClimateChange)
[its challenge](http://tnp_encoded_videos.s3.amazonaws.com/web_videos/140927_FONG_FULL_WEB_9100.mp4).
I want to focus my passion for problem solving onto tackling the climate crisis:
energy, the grid, transportation, politicsâ€”whatever it takes.

## Current Technical Interests
**Julia lang**  {% include icon-julia-logo-three-balls.html %} I'm super excited about the future of the [Julia Language](https://julialang.org)! I attended [JuliaCon 2017](http://juliacon.org/2017/) in Berkeley, and am looking forward to [JuliaCon 2018](http://juliacon.org/2018/) in London!

It was actually Brett Victor's Climate Change essay I linked above,
[worrydream.com/ClimateChange](worrydream.com/ClimateChange), that first
introduced me to Julia and motivated me to contribute!
