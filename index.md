Hi! I'm a Software Engineer, and sometimes an actor, currently working on the
google.com web server (GWS) at Google in Chicago.

I'm [terrified](https://xkcd.com/1732/)
[about](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPCC_Fifth_Assessment_Report#Projections)
Climate Change. I'm also [inspired by](http://worrydream.com/ClimateChange)
[its challenge](http://tnp_encoded_videos.s3.amazonaws.com/web_videos/140927_FONG_FULL_WEB_9100.mp4).
I have been privileged in my career so far to work with amazingly smart people
and learn so much from them. Now I want to refocus my skills and passions for
problem solving and engineering toward tackling the climate crisis.

Great software is and will continue to be a critical part of developing the
technologies we desperately need: clean energy, energy storage, a smart grid,
energy efficiency, clean transportation, and more. I am ready to use my
experience and dedication to make that technology greater.
