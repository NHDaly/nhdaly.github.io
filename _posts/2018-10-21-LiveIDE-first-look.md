  Introducing the LiveIDE project I'm building

## LiveIDE
I've been building a tool for live-debugging and editing julia code! It's
inspired by Bret Victor's 2012 [Inventing on
Principle](https://vimeo.com/36579366) talk. That talk also inspired similar
tools, like [Hydrogen](https://github.com/nteract/hydrogen), the jupyter
notebook integration for the [Atom](https://github.com/atom/atom) code editor.

I've been working on it since September 2018. I'm currently calling it _LiveIDE_,
but the name is a work-in-progress.

Here's a video I took last month, after the first 4 hours of work on this. (It
was so fast to build! Julia is the best!):<br>

I've been using it to test itself nowadays, which has actually been really
helpful! In this screenshot, I'm using `Live.@testfile` to automatically create
live debug inputs for my function _based on the existing unit tests!_:

</p>

This next example shows more `Live.@testfile` auto testing by using
itself as the unit test file:<br>

And of course, it can also act more like a Jupyter notebook with the
`Live.@script` tag, causing the whole file to be interpreted:

</p>

I'm excited about the future of this project! Expect more updates in the future!
