    "# Writing a simple SQL interpreter in Julia\n",
    "\n",
    "So I've felt for a while that databases and SQL were somewhat of a weak spot in my CS knowledge. I've never taken a databases class, nor really read much about them. Though a few years' on-the-job exposure did help some (I could, like, put together a query to get some data), it just didn't feel _intuitive_. I used to say things like, \"but what does this `join` really _meannn_??? Like, what's it actually _doing!?_\"\n",
    "\n",
    "So I took the Khan Academy [\"Intro to SQL\"](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/sql) course over the weekend, and it was super helpful! I'd highly recommend it to anyone who felt like me. Cause it turns out, hey, a `join` is really simple! All it's doing is basically computing the Cartesian Product of your two tables, and then filtering out rows based on how you specified the query. No big deal.\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "So then, of course, armed with my new knowledge, I couldn't resist trying to implement it all myself. And man, things like this are just so _fun_ in julia!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So here's the result! I thought it would be fun to paste this up on the web just because it's a cool example of building a domain-specific-language within julia through its super expressive metaprogramming.\n"

This concept comes from `lisp`, and it's central to how julia works: at runtime, julia is parsing every bit of the code you provide it into _julia_ data structures: `Expr`s, `Symbol`s and literals (ints, strings, etc), and then evaluating those structures.\n",
